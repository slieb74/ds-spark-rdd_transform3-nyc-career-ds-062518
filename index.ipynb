    "Recall the `map(func)` action that used a function to transform RDD contents. `map()` will return more or less than one element. Suppose you want your newly created RDD to consist of the elements generated by the function provided. Using a simple `map()` action would result the new RDD being made up iterators having 0 to many elements. We are often interested in the values contained within those iterators. This is where we can use `flatMap()` transformation, which is similar to `map()` except that each element in the input gets mapped to zero or more output elements. "

We saw how the output of a flatmap transformation results as new RDD with elements directly accessible, as compared to iterators outputted by map transformations. We also saw the difference between `groupByKey()` and `reduceByKey()` for paired RDDs containing (key, value) pairs. We shall now move on to developing spark applications using these transformations in following labs. "
